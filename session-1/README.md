# Session-01 Packages

## Session-1-Start

This starting package contains the following:

* 5 subgraphs (FlipImage, IsGrounded, MoveXAxis, MoveYAxis, SlideDown)
* Spritesheets > Main Characters > Ninja Frog > Idle spritesheet

The scene has walls and a ground setup, with Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D components added to the frog character.


## Session-2-Reference

This is meant to be a reference for the teacher. Shows the expected output of the day - what the graphs should look like, what the end goal should be.
